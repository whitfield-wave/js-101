input: quantity of minutes before or after midnight
output: String of time in 24hr after adding/subtracting given quantity of minutes

Examples:
console.log(timeOfDay(0) === "00:00");
console.log(timeOfDay(-3) === "23:57");
console.log(timeOfDay(35) === "00:35");
console.log(timeOfDay(-1437) === "00:03");
    1440min in 24hrs
console.log(timeOfDay(3000) === "02:00");
    3000 minutes = 50hrs
    midnight is 1440min
    3000 - 1440 = 1560
    1560 - 1440 = 120
    120min is 2hrs so 2AM
console.log(timeOfDay(800) === "13:20");
console.log(timeOfDay(-4231) === "01:29");


Data Type:
input and calculations with numbers
output to String

Algorithm:

1440min in 24 hours. We can represent any time in a 24hr clock with the quantity of minutes upto 1440. 
If a given quanity of minutes is greater than 1440 in absolute value, we can subtract 1440 until it's <= 1440.
    If the original quantity was negative, we need to subtract it FROM 1440 to get the final minute value of time. 
That minute value gives us the final time which needs to be converted to clock time and a string.

minute value of clock time / minutes_in_hr gives us the hours with a decimal value of the minutes.
round the decimal off for the hour
min value of clock time % minutes_in_hr gives us minutes
return 'hour : minutes'
